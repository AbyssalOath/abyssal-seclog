// Reversible secret encryption -- deliberately separate from auth.rs.
//
// Every credential auth.rs deals with (passwords, session tokens, agent
// API keys, enrollment tokens) only ever needs to be VERIFIED: hash it,
// compare hashes, done. The LDAP bind password is the first secret in
// this codebase that Abyssal SecLog has to hand back to a third party (the
// directory server) on every sync, so it has to be recoverable. Mixing
// "one-way, can never be recovered" and "two-way, recoverable by design"
// in one file would make it too easy for a future change to blur which
// is which -- keeping them apart is the point.

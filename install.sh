# This script's job is that nobody who runs it ever has to hand-edit
# .env -- every variable docker-compose.yml needs either gets generated
# silently (a secret: DB_ROOT_PASS, DB_PASS, SECLOG_MASTER_KEY, same
# idea as `openssl rand`) or prompted for (a decision only a human can
# make: FRONTEND_ORIGIN, the Caddy/reverse-proxy choice). Every block
# below follows the same idempotent shape: check whether its var(s)
# already exist in .env, and only generate/prompt if they don't -- safe
# to re-run install.sh on an existing install, e.g. after pulling a
# version that adds a new one.
#
# Adding a new environment variable that docker-compose.yml needs?
# 1. Add it to docker-compose.yml's `environment:` block (and
#    docker-compose.dev.yml's, if the dev stack needs it too).
# 2. Add a generation-or-prompt block here, following the pattern
#    above: a secret gets generated silently, anything requiring a
#    human decision gets a `read -rp` prompt.
# 3. The check near the end of this script (search for "Safety net")
#    will catch anything missed here -- but that's a last resort, not
#    a substitute for step 2. A warning during install is a much worse
#    experience than never seeing the gap at all.
